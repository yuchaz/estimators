1. `bootstrap.py` is for question 4. To run this code, run `python bootstrap.py`
1. `gt_estimate.py` is for question 5. There are two arguments in running this. First is the `--mode`, you can either use `binom` or `poisson` smoothing technique. The second argument is `--upper-bound`, which specifies the upper bound of `t`. Run `python gt_estimate.py -h` for further instruction.
